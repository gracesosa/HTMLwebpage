		<!-- #3 Two paragraphs about myself -->
		<p>Hi, my name is  Grace Sosa. I am a <em>current</em> first year Statistics Major at NC State Univeristy.
		I am also interested in a possible Computer Programming major. I picked this major because I enjoy problem solving,
		math, and examining data and probabilities. I have always found myself to be an <strong>intuitive</strong> problem solver,
		and I find it <u>exciting</u> when I am able to figure out an issue or trouble shoot.
		I like to do activities like logic puzzles, Scrabble, word games, chess, solitaire, and sudoku in my free time.
		</p>
		
		<br />
		
		<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:16px; color:#0000AA; text-align:left"> As for my current job, I work as a Retail Associate at the NC Museum of Natural Sciences.
		I work at the Musuem Gift Store selling science themed products, while engaging with
		muesum visitors and customers. We sell anything from t-shirts to rocks to books and stuffed animals.
		Through this job, I have gained more knowledge in natural science topics,
		as well as strengthened communication skills.
		</p>
